# Built-in Default Configuration

`config/default.json` is the default configuration shipped with the client and must remain available. Desktop reads it from the packaged files, while Web imports it at build time. The built-in values are used when the remote request fails or does not contain valid fields.

## Help and Community Configuration

The community and feedback entry points request `GET /api/v1/client/configs` from the current endpoint and read `data.configs.feedbackUrl`.

- `community_urls["zh-CN" | "en-US"]`: legacy locale keys are retained for compatibility; the product UI is English-only.
- `feedback_url`: a valid remote URL takes precedence over the built-in URL.
- `feedback_use_external_form`: a remote boolean takes precedence; `false` is also a valid override.

Requests include `app_version`. Desktop also includes `platform-arch`; Web omits the platform parameter. Successful responses are cached in memory for one hour. Requests use `cache: no-store`, and failures are not cached.

```text
GET endpoint /api/v1/client/configs -> valid help fields -> platform entry
                         | missing / failure
                         v
                built-in default.json -> platform entry
```

`default.json` is distributed with the client. Legacy CDN-related fields remain only for compatibility; the current version relies on this built-in file and preserves the other fields required by existing consumers.

See [community entry configuration](../docs/ui/settings-community-link-config.md) for detailed rules.
